KnowGo Event Triggers and Connector for OpenFaaS

This repository supports using [knowgo-pubsub] messages as triggers for OpenFaaS functions, using the OpenFaaS
`connector-sdk`.

[knowgo-pubsub]: https://github.com/knowgoio/knowgo-pubsub

The connector itself is derived from some of the other ones that exhibit
similar behaviour, such as the [MQTT] and [Kafka] Connectors.
